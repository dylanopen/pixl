# Pixl

> The lightweight, powerful Rust game engine and rasterizer built from scratch.

Pixl isn't like other game engines.

Instead of focusing on adding every possible feature under the sun, it focuses
on doing a few things really well: the graphics.  
Pixl is a 2D game engine and rasterizer written entirely in Rust from the
ground up. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, making it
ideal for small or medium-sized game and graphics projects which *don't* need
the bloat.

## Features

- Lightweight - a tiny number of dependencies
- Quick compile times
- Easy to use API
- 100% documentation coverage
- Fully software rasterized - none of the pain of working with GPUs
- Ecosystem of extension crates for additional functionality

## Documentation
